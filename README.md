# HTTP-Loop
Looping a webpage. Why? To test out the response rate of bots on youtube mostly. Goal is to see if I can get a video flagged by a http loop on Youtube.

<h2> Results from test a bunch of null objects from youtube with links to policies and cross site scripting security warning</h2>

<h2>Figure Youtube had something in place but it was nice to see it in action</h2>
