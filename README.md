# Youtube-http-req-loop
Looping a webpage. Why? To test out the response on youtube mostly. Edit: Youtube just sends back null objects and links to their security pages. Eh it was fun to test.
<br><br>
<h2> Results from test a bunch of null objects from youtube with links to policies and cross site scripting security warning</h2>
<br>
<h2>Figure Youtube had something in place but it was nice to see it in action</h2>
